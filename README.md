# my-recipebook
The My Recipebook application is a platform that allows a user to search through numerous recipes that are either saved by a user to their account or accessed via searching a type of recipe on the home page - provided by Spoonacular API. It utilises the MERN stack to store and retrieve recipes that have been saved. It uses Vite as the bundler.
